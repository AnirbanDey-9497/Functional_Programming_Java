# Functional_Programming_Java

This project is a collection of Java programs demonstrating the principles and techniques of functional programming using Java 8+ features such as streams, lambda expressions, and functional interfaces.

## Features

- **Stream API Examples:** Learn how to use streams for filtering, mapping, reducing, and collecting data.
- **Functional Interfaces:** See practical uses of built-in interfaces like `Predicate`, `Function`, and `Consumer`.
- **Custom Classes:** Explore functional programming with custom data types and more complex operations.
- **Comparators and Sorting:** Understand how to sort collections using functional programming constructs.
- **Practice Problems:** Multiple files provide hands-on practice with functional programming concepts.

## Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `FP01Functional*.java`: Basic functional programming with numbers and strings.
  - `FP02Functional_*.java`, `FP02_Comparator.java`, `FP02_Collectors.java`, etc.: Intermediate examples with streams, comparators, and collectors.
  - `FP03Functional_Interfaces.java`, `FP03Functional_Practice.java`: Usage of functional interfaces and practice exercises.
  - `FP04CustomClass*.java`: Advanced examples using custom classes and predicates.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Functional_Programming_Java
   ```

2. **Compile the code:**
   ```sh
   javac -d out src/*.java
   ```

3. **Run an example:**
   ```sh
   java -cp out src.FP01Functional
   ```

   Replace `src.FP01Functional` with any other class name to run different examples.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher

## Learning Goals

- Understand the basics and power of functional programming in Java.
- Practice using streams and lambda expressions for concise, readable code.
- Learn to use and implement functional interfaces.
- Apply functional programming to real-world-like problems with custom classes.
